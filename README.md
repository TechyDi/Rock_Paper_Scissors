# Rock Paper Scissors Game in Java

Welcome to the **Rock Paper Scissors** game project! This simple yet classic game is implemented in Java, providing a great opportunity for beginners to learn about Java programming concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling. Feel free to explore, play, and enhance this code!

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the program, and you‚Äôll be greeted with a welcome message.
2. **Choose Rounds**: Enter the number of rounds you want to play. You can type "exit" anytime to leave the game.
3. **Make Your Move**: Choose either "rock", "paper", or "scissors" when prompted.
4. **Game Outcome**: After each round, the result is displayed, and you can see if you won, lost, or drew.
5. **Game Over**: At the end of all rounds, the total wins are displayed.

## üìù Code Explanation

Let's break down the code to understand each part!

### 1. **Main Method**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Scanner object to take user input
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    // Welcome and instructions
    System.out.println("\nWELCOME TO THE Rock_Paper_Scissors GAME");
    System.out.println("\nPRESS 'EXIT' to exit the game at any time.");
    System.out.println("\nHow many rounds of Rock_Paper_Scissors would you like to play?");

    // Handling input for number of rounds or exit command
    String input = sc.nextLine();
    if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) {
        System.out.println("Game exited. Goodbye!");
        sc.close();
        return;
    }

    // Converting input to integer for number of rounds
    int round;
    try {
        round = Integer.parseInt(input);
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        System.out.println("Invalid input for the number of rounds. Exiting game.");
        sc.close();
        return;
    }

    int x = 0; // Loop counter
    int playersWinscount = 0; // To count player wins
    while (x < round) {
        boolean playerwon = playRPS(sc);
        if (playerwon) {
            playersWinscount++;
        }
        x++;
    }

    // Display total wins
    System.out.println("\nTOTAL WINS: " + playersWinscount);
    sc.close();
}
```

- **Scanner sc**: Used to read user input from the console.
- **Main Loop**: Controls the number of rounds played based on user input.
- **Error Handling**: Exits gracefully if the user provides invalid input for the number of rounds.

### 2. **The `playRPS` Method**

```java
static Boolean playRPS(Scanner sc) {
    // Prompt user for a move
    String playerMove;
    while (true) {
        System.out.println("\nMake a move! (rock/paper/scissors)");
        playerMove = sc.nextLine().toLowerCase(); // Converts input to lowercase for consistency

        // Exit check
        if (playerMove.equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) {
            System.out.println("Game exited. Goodbye!");
            System.exit(0); // Exits the program
        }

        // Validity check for input
        if (playerMove.equals("rock") || playerMove.equals("paper") || playerMove.equals("scissors")) {
            break;
        } else {
            System.out.println("\nINVALID INPUT. PLEASE TRY AGAIN.");
        }
    }

    // Generate computer's move
    Random random = new Random();
    int randomNum = random.nextInt(3);

    // Determine computer's move based on random number
    String computerMove;
    if (randomNum == 0) {
        computerMove = "rock";
    } else if (randomNum == 1) {
        computerMove = "paper";
    } else {
        computerMove = "scissors";
    }
    System.out.println("Computer Choose " + computerMove + "!");

    // Determine the result of the game
    if (playerMove.equals(computerMove)) {
        System.out.println("AWWWW ! It's A Draw.");
        return false;
    } else if (playerWins(playerMove, computerMove)) {
        System.out.println("HURRAY ! You Win.");
        return true;
    } else {
        System.out.println("You Lost Buddy. Let's Try Again.");
        return false;
    }
}
```

- **User Input**: Continuously prompts the user until a valid move ("rock", "paper", or "scissors") is entered.
- **Random Generation**: Uses `Random` to simulate the computer's move.
- **Game Logic**: Determines the winner by comparing the player's move and the computer's move.

### 3. **The `playerWins` Method**

```java
static boolean playerWins(String playerMove, String computerMove) {
    if (playerMove.equals("rock")) {
        return computerMove.equals("scissors");
    } else if (playerMove.equals("paper")) {
        return computerMove.equals("rock");
    } else {
        return computerMove.equals("paper");
    }
}
```

- **Determining the Winner**: This method checks if the player's move beats the computer's move based on standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

## üöÄ Getting Started
